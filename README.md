Hi! I'm Oad! Right now, I'm focused on two things I enjoy: improving everyday processes to make them faster and more fun, and creating interactive tools that make learning engaging and exciting.

On this website, I share my mini pet projects and cool findings I've encountered along my learning and building journeys. You can also explore my work [here](https://www.phanuphats.com/).

This blog website was originally hosted in this [repository](https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/oadultradeepfield.github.io) and powered by Jekyll. The new website now runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Typo](https://tomfran.github.io/typo-wiki/) theme, created by [Francesco Tomaselli](https://tomfran.github.io/).
