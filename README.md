Hi! I'm Oad! Right now, I'm focused on two things I enjoy: improving everyday processes to make them faster and more fun, and creating interactive tools that make learning engaging and exciting.

On this website, I share my mini pet projects and cool findings I've encountered along my learning and building journeys. You can also explore my work [here](https://www.phanuphats.com/).
