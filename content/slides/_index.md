These are supplementary materials I created during my studies, mainly at NUS. I categorize them by topic and semester when applicable.

**Note**: My cheat sheet covers only what I often forget or what helps with problem-solving and reducing errors, not everything.

## CS2030S

- [PE0 Cheat Sheet](cs2030s/2425s2-pe0.html)

## CS2100

For CS2100, I also created this [instruction encoding reference sheet](https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/mim-cs2100), which is arguably easier and faster to use than the provided one.
