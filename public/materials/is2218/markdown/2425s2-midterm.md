# IS2218 Midterm Cheat Sheet

### Useful Formula from Session 1

```tex
Total Assets = Equity + Total Liabilities
Market Value of Equity = Stock Price * Number of Shares
Net Working Capital = Current (Assets - Liabilities)
Increased in Retained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends
Gross Investment = Changes in Fixed Assets + Depreciation
```

**Note**: For later problems, where debt-equity ratio = 1. We can say that `Total Liabilities = Debt` to simplify the problem.

### Useful Formula from Session 2 - 3 (1/2)

```tex
CFO = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditure
```

For tracking the changes of the firm's cash balance:

```tex
Outflow = Cost of Goods Sold + Change in Inventories
Inflow = Net Sales - Change in Uncollected Bills
```

**Note**: `CFO` = Cashflow From Operations and `Change in Uncollected Bills` = Change in Accounts Receivable (`Accounts Payable` works in the opposite way).

### Useful Formula from Session 2 - 3 (2/2)

```tex
Free Cash Flow = CFO + CFI + Interest Expenses
                   - Changes in NWC
```

```tex
Net Income = EBIT - Interest Expenses - Taxes
```

```tex
EBIT = Net Sales - Cost of Goods Sold - Depreciation
```

**Note**: `CFI` = Cashflow From Investment and `EBIT` = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (1/7)

```tex
Market Capitalization = Market Value of Equity
MVA = (Market - Book) Value of Equity
Market-to-Book Ratio = (Market / Book) Value of Equity
```

```tex
EVA = After Tax Operating Income -
      (Cost of Capital * Total Capitalization)
```

**Note**: `MVA` & `EVA` = Market & Economic Value Added and `Book Value = Current Assets - Depreciation (& Expense)`.

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (2/7)

where `After Tax Operating Income`

```tex
= (1 - Tax Rate) * Interest Expense + Net Income
= (1 - Tax Rate) * EBIT
```

and `Total Capitalization`

```tex
= Long-Term Debt + Equity
```

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (3/7)

Rates of Return

```tex
ROC = After Tax Operating Income / Total Capitalization
ROA = After Tax Operating Income / Total Assets
ROE = Net Income / Equity
```

**Note**: `RO_` refers to Return on `C (Capital)`, `A (Assets)`, and `E (Equity)`. It could be calculated using the values at the beginning or the averages, depending on the problem.

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (4/7)

```tex
Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales /
                       Total Assets at Start of Year
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold /
                           Inventory at Start of Year
Receivables Turnover Ratio = Net Sales /
                             Receivables at Start of Year
```

**Note**: `Average Days in Inventory` and `Average Collection Period` are the inverses of the last two times `365`.

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (5/7)

**DuPoint** System

```tex
Profit Margin = Net Income / Net Sales
Operating Profit Margin = After Tax Operating Income /
                          Net Sales
```

With some derivation:

```tex
ROA = Asset Turnover Ratio * Operating Profit Margin
```

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (6/7)

```tex
ROE = Leverage Ratio * ROA * Debt Burden
```

where `Leverage Ratio` is `Total Assets / Equity` and `Debt Burden` is `Net Income / After Tax Operating Income`.

```tex
Long-Term Debt Ratio = Long-Term Debt /
                       Total Capitalization
Long-Term Debt-Equity Ratio = Long-Term Debt / Equity
Total Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets
```

### Useful Formula from Session 4 - 5 (7/7)

```tex
Times Interest Earned Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expenses
Cash Coverage Ratio = (EBIT + Depreciation) /
                      Interest Expenses
```

Measuring Liquidity (each is divided by `Current Liabilities`)

```tex
Current Ratio = Current Assets
Quick Ratio = Cash + Marketable Securities +
              Account Receivables
            = Current Assets - Inventories
Cash Ratio = Cash + Marketable Securities
```
